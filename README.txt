The driver for generating adaptive single-level SC-FEM approximations is
singlelevelSC.m

The driver for generating adaptive multilevel SC-FEM approximations is
multilevelSC.m

The default implementation is for a Unix architecture.
On a Windows machine, run the script-file
install_adaptive_scfem.m 
before running the above main drivers for the first time.
